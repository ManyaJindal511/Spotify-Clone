# Spotify Clone

A simple **Spotify clone** built using HTML and CSS. This project focuses on replicating the **UI/UX** of Spotify's web interface. It is a **static clone**, so it does not have any real functionality or backend integration.

## Demo

You can open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the layout.
